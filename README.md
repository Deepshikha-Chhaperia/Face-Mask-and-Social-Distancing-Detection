# Face-Mask-and-Social-Distancing-Detection
## Introduction

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based approach to detect whether individuals are wearing masks and to identify violations of social distancing norms in images. It combines face detection, mask detection, and social distancing evaluation to provide actionable insights. The solution is built using Haar Cascade for face detection and a VGG19-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for mask classification.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher
- **pip**: Python package installer
- **Libraries**: Ensure the following libraries are installed:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `opencv-python-headless`
  - `scipy`
  - `keras`
